  author   = "Aikio, Sami and Duncan, Richard P and Hulme, Philip E",
  abstract = "Temporal trends in biological invasions are often described by a
              lag-phase of little or no increase in species occurrence followed
              by an increase-phase in which species occurrence rises rapidly.
              While several biological and environmental mechanisms may
              underlie lag-phases, they may also represent statistical
              artefacts or temporal changes in sampling effort. To date,
              distinguishing the facts from these artefacts has not been
              possible. Here we describe a method for estimating the lag-phase
              in cumulative records of species occurrence, using a piecewise
              regression model that explicitly differentiates the lag and
              increase phases. We used the von Bertalanffy, logistic, linear
              and exponential functions to model the increase phase, and
              identified the best-fitting function using model selection
              techniques. We confirmed the accuracy of our method using
              simulated data and then estimated the length of the lag-phase
              (tlag), the maximum collection rate (r) and the projected
              asymptotic number of records (K) using herbarium records for 105
              weed species in New Zealand, while accounting for changes in
              sampling effort. Nearly all the New Zealand weed species had a
              lag-phase, which averaged around 20?30 years, with 4\% of species
              having a lag-phase greater than 40 years. In more than two thirds
              of the cases, the accumulation of records was best modelled with
              the decelerating von Bertalanffy function, despite the tendency
              for temporal variation in sampling effort to force cumulative
              herbarium records to follow the sigmoidal shape of a logistic
              curve. A positive correlation between r and K is consistent with
              the assumption that the final distribution of an alien plant
              species reflects its rate of spread. Seemingly rare but
              fast-spreading aliens may thus become tomorrow's noxious weeds. A
              positive correlation between inflection year and r warns that the
              weeds that have only begun to spread relatively recently may
              spread faster than previously known invaders.",

              of invasion lag-phases",
  author   = "Hyndman, R J and Mesgaran, M B and Cousens, R D",
  abstract = "Current methods for using herbarium data as time series, for
              example to estimate the length of the invasion lag phase, often
              make assumptions that are both statistically and logically
              inappropriate. We present an alternative statistical approach,
              estimating the lag phase based on annual rather than cumulative
              data, a generalized linear model incorporating a log link for
              overall collection effort, and piecewise linear splines. We
              demonstrate the method on two species representing good and poor
              data quality, then apply it to two data sets comprising 448
              species/region combinations. Significant lags were detected in
              only 28 and 40 \% of time series, a much lower level than the 95
              and 77 \% found in previous analyses of the same data. In a case
              with high quality data, a lag was concluded even though during
              the ``lag'' the locations of herbarium collections indicated that
              it was spreading rapidly at a continental scale. In species with
              few records, results were sensitive to the way in which zeroes
              were included. Overall, our method gives very good fit to the
              data, avoids unrealistic assumptions of other methods and gives
              more reliable estimates of confidence. However, given the poor
              representation of herbarium samples in the early stages of
              invasions and the fact that they do not constitute a structured
              survey of abundance, we warn against over-reliance on statistical
              analysis of such data to reach conclusions about the dynamics of
              invasions.",
